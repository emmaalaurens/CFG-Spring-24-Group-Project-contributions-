My conprehensive testing suite was based on the directories that I pushed based on best practice. It was to unit test using Jest the functionality of the backend. 
I used Jest as it was already being used (so I was told) by another team member - and it works well with APIs as well as react applications. 

Using node.js, I prepared a testing suite by updating the package.json to include a test 'scripts'. 

I made a tests directory in the backend folder: 
mkdir __tests__ 

{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
}

in terminal: npm test
